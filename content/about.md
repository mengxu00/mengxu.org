A little goes a long way.

I am slowly realizing my inner strength and responsibility which goes with that strength. I am moving, somewhat ignorantly and clumsily, towards accepting a position of full responsibility and reliability for my family, career, and myself. 

I am frightened to live an aimless, ungratifying life. I feel extremely competitive toward many things, and I am annoyed and humiliated when I fail. 

I make many mistakes. I am often inconsistent. I am far from being perfect. Yet I have found that whether I suceed or fail, I learn. Such learning has been a prime element in making my life worthwhile.

I have complex and contradictory feelings toward freedom and independence: I desire these and am proud of how much I have earned, and yet I am often frightened by what they might mean.

I value and respect the dignity and worth of each individual. I deeply enjoy and cherish meaningful relationships with many.

I pursued intelligence as if it is the most valuable thing in the universe, yet as I grow, I become more and more able to appreciate wisdom.
