If you played chess, you might know that there are situations that you seemingly could take one of your opponent's piece for free. But you know you will instead hold your position. Because if you do, you may weaken your defence, and leave opportunity for your opponent to take advantage of. The seemingly free piece is therefor called a "poisonous" piece.

I took back home $3,300 each month when I was a postdoc researcher. After paying off the two biggest monthly bills ($1700 for rent, and $900 preschool), we had $600 left for a family of three. Of couse, there are many small bills - gas, car insurance, cell phone, and utility bills. Luckily we had some savings from my wife, Robin's previous job as an engineer. Other wise, we may no have enough for food. We were poor, and happy. I enjoy the feeling of the new start. We had nothing but potential.

Ocassionally we took vacations to parks or beaches, I spent.

Any achievement is also an obstacle, at the same time. You have to let what you value go, as soon as you get it.
