You're right about thinking.

And the ultimate target to think about would be the unthinkable.

This is important because there's a limit of thinkable space. And it's interesting and practical to know limits.

More importantly, only part of a human thinks. And it can act against the rest of the body. No surprise, we know ourselves best.

Right after Adam and Eve understood good and evil, the first thing they did was judging themselves. Buddha attempted to conquer the innate appetites for food, sex, and comfort, after he first saw the suffering of poverty, disease, and death. Writers have hard time writing anything down because they criticiss themsleves in a harsh and unproductive way. Parinters practice sketching with a photo 180 degree reversed in front of them. These are techniques to temporarily turn off our logical thinking function. Life is surely less productive if we only think.

The key is to be in alignment.

Accept the part of soul that is beyond thoughts. Accept that a part of the soul is evil.

Evil is an organic part of life. Because life feeds on life. In order for one to live, another life has to die.
