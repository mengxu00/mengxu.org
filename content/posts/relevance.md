Take your favorite room at home as an example. It is filled with light waves, visible and invisible, from infra-red to untra-vielet. In addition, there are also radio waves, natural radiations, and X-rays from the galaxy. But we only have a pair of detectors, each about 2-8 milimiters in diameter, to sense visible light spectrum. It is true that we only perceive a tiny fracton of electromagnetic fields filled in the room.

Only a little part of the world is relevant to our life.
