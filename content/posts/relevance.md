If only a catapilla could tell its stories.


What's bugging you is your conscience calling to you. There are lots of things might bug you. Many of the mdon't, but some of them do. Why do those bug you not other things? There is part of your pasyche that is oriented towards furthre development [the self, according to Jung, the totality of everything you could be]. The way your potential calls upon you at the present is by placing problems in front of you. And they announce themselves as your problem. And they do that by bothering you. So if you pick up the problem and fix things that bothers you, you further develop your personality.

When you are despairing because your father had died and your tradition has nothing to offer, the positive elements of the unknown might provide you wth a message about where to go, if you pay enough attention. That would be an intuition, or an automatic attraction of your interest to a new thing by forces that you do not understand.

The things that direct your as a being are not things that you can consciously choose. They are directed by other forces.  


You can easily make a case that movies are more real than normal life. Because if not, why would you watch a move in stead of a video-taped normal life? Is fiction more real than normal life? Is abstraction more real than reality?

Much of your motivations are unconscious.

We're surrounded by things we at certain level of analysis seize to understand.

They call this type of situation a "flow" state. These activities are often by no means easy. There's little to no correlation between the leve lof difficulty and 

The best way to update existing theory is, in my estimation, to learn from exceptions. To note your error, articulate them, and strive to fix.

This also mean that you can't fall in love with your most reliable theories no matter how much rationality it contains. Instead, you have to always allow room for updates.

This means that the more we learn the more ignorance we discover about ourselves. This also mean everyone makes mistakes no matter how.

To nature, this tiny fraction of the world's information is exactly what we need to survive and reproduce, or that's the best evolution can do.

Take your favorite room at home as an example. It is filled with light waves, visible and invisible, from infra-red to untra-vielet. In addition, there are also radio waves, natural radiations, and X-rays from the galaxy. But we only have a pair of detectors, each about 2-8 milimiters in diameter, to sense visible light spectrum. It is true that we only perceive a tiny fracton of electromagnetic fields filled in the room.

Only a little part of the world is relevant to our life.
