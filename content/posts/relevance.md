What's bugging you is your conscience calling to you. There are lots of things might bug you. Many of the mdon't, but some of them do. Why do those bug you not other things? There is part of your pasyche that is oriented towards furthre development [the self, according to Jung, the totality of everything you could be]. The way your potential calls upon you at the present is by placing problems in front of you. And they announce themselves as your problem. And they do that by bothering you. So if you pick up the problem and fix things that bothers you, you further develop your personality.

When you are despairing because your father had died and your tradition has nothing to offer, the positive elements of the unknown might provide you wth a message about where to go, if you pay enough attention. That would be an intuition, or an automatic attraction of your interest to a new thing by forces that you do not understand.

The things that direct your as a being are not things that you can consciously choose. They are directed by other forces.  


You can easily make a case that movies are more real than normal life. Because if not, why would you watch a move in stead of a video-taped normal life? Is fiction more real than normal life? Is abstraction more real than reality?

Much of your motivations are unconscious.

We're surrounded by things we at certain level of analysis seize to understand. 

Relavance determines productivity. Not time or time management. You are most productive in activities that naturally engages you. Many people can focus on video games, wood work, etc. for hours. They call this type of situation a "flow" state. These activities are often by no means easy. There's little to no correlation between the leve lof difficulty and 

The best way to update existing theory is, in my estimation, to learn from exceptions. To note your error, articulate them, and strive to fix.

This also mean that you can't fall in love with your most reliable theories no matter how much rationality it contains. Instead, you have to always allow room for updates.

This means that the more we learn the more ignorance we discover about ourselves. This also mean everyone makes mistakes no matter how.

To nature, this tiny fraction of the world's information is exactly what we need to survive and reproduce, or that's the best evolution can do.

Take your favorite room at home as an example. It is filled with light waves, visible and invisible, from infra-red to untra-vielet. In addition, there are also radio waves, natural radiations, and X-rays from the galaxy. But we only have a pair of detectors, each about 2-8 milimiters in diameter, to sense visible light spectrum. It is true that we only perceive a tiny fracton of electromagnetic fields filled in the room.

Only a little part of the world is relevant to our life.

### Appendix
### Why
I had strong wishes that I have good plans for life. Becasue in this way I can rule out obviously non-practical opportunities. A sounds plan also provides expectations of the future. This really helps with anxiety management.

However I also knew that future is rather unpredictable because we have very limitead knowledge of the current state - where we are right now. I want to explore how to plan and act in a rather non-predictable world by writing down pieces of thought and examine overtime.

I also feel that my ideas are quite fragmented. I feel that each idea is like searching a dim, long-lost name in my head. It becomes an impossible job to access when there is a list of 20 names like that. It would be interesting to lay them out at the same place and to put pieces together into a coherent line of thoughts.

* 

### Starting points
* We are very blind to the information around us
* The tiny portion of things we pay attention to is what relevant to us. This is proved in action.
* If we're suffering, it might be well becasue of our limitation of attention
* Worse, that What relevant to us, or precisely what we value the most, might be the biggest obstacle preventing us from looking somewhere else.
* There are numerous 
* Facts relevant to one aim
* The morden individual, for whom all the gods are dead, must look to the forces within for answers to the spiritual problems which plague them. - Jung
* Small and hidden is the door that leads inward, and the entrance is barred b countless prejudices, mistaken assumptions and fears. Always one wishes to hear of gramd political and economic schemes, the very things that have landed every nation in a norass. Therefore it sounds grotesque when anyone speaks of hidden doors, dreams, and a world within. What has this vapid idealism got to do with gifantic economic programmes, with the so-called problems of reality? - Jung
* But I speak not to nations, only to the individual few, for whom it goes without saying that cultural values do not drop down like manna from heaven but are created by the hands of individuals. If things go wrong in the world, this because something is wrong with the individual, because something is wrong with me. Therefore, if I am sensible, I shall put myself right first. For this I need - because outside authority no loger means anything to me - a knowledge of the innermost foundations of my being, in order that I may base myself firmly on the eternal facts of the human psyche. - Jung
* ...in what myth does a man live nowadays? In the Christian myth, the answer might be. " do you live in it?" I asked myself, the answer was no. For me it is not what I live by. "Then do we no longer have any myth?" "No, evidently we no longer have any myth." "But then what is your myth - the myth in which you do live?" At this point the dialogue with myself became uncomfortable, and I stopped thinking. I had reached a dead end. - Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections

* Only one who has risked the fight with the dragon and is not overcome by it wins the hoard, the "treasure hard to attain". He alone has a genuine claim to self-confidence, for he has faced the dark ground of his self and thereby has gained himself. This experience gives some faith and trust...in the ability of the self to sustain him, for everything that menaced him from inside he has made his own. He has acquired that right to believe that he will be able to overcome all future threats by the same means. He has arrived at an inner certainty which makes him capable of self-reliance. - Jung, The symbloic life

* Projection is one of the commonest psychic phenomena...Everything that is unconscious in ourselves we discover in our neighbour and we treat him accordingly. - Jung, Archaic man

* When one tries desperatey to be good and wonderful and perfect, then all the more the shadow develops a definite will to e black and evil and destructive. People cannot see that; they are always striving to be marcellous, and then they discover that terrible destructive things happen which they cannot understand, and they either deny that such facts have anything to do with them, or if they admit them, they take them for natural afflictions, or they try to minimize them and to shift the responsibility elsewhere. The fact is that if one tries beyond one's capacity to be perfect, the shadow descends into hell and becomes the devil. - Jung, Visions: notes of the seminar given in 1930-1934

* The line deviding good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

* Mordern people are ignorant of what they really are. We have simply forgotten what a human being really is, so we have men like Nietzsche and Freud and Adler, who tell us what we are, quite mercilessly. We have to discover our shadow. Otherwise we are driven into a world war in order to see what beasts we are. - Jung, notes of the seminar given in 1930-1934

* One should never think that man can reach perfection, he can only aim at completion - not to be perfect but to be complete. That would be the necessity and the indispensable condition if there were any questions of percection at all. For how can you perfect a thing if it is not complete?
Make it complete first and see what it is then. Nut to make it complete is already a mountain of a task, and by the time you arrive at absolute completion, you find that you are already dead, so you never reach that preliminary condition for perfecting yourself. - Jung, Visions: notes of the seminar given in 1930-1934

* Individuation is the process whereby one becomes increasingy conscious of the symbolic manifestations of the archetypes, thus gaining knowledge of the timeless "patterns of human life".

* Many people reach to a point that they believe they are the social masks they wear. It is imperative for anyone who wishes to take the conscious path of individuation to accept that their social mask represents but a sliver of their total personality.

* It is a most painful proceure to tear off those veils, but each step forward in psychological development means just that, the tearing off of a new veil. We are like onions with many skins, and we have to peel ourseves again and again in order to get at the real core. - Jung, Visions: notes of the seminar given in 1930-1934

* Only the sharpest need is able to rouse it. The development of personality obeys no wish, no comman, and no insight, but only need; it wants the motivating coercion of inner or outer necessities. - Jung

* The saying, "for many are called, but few are chosen," applies here as nowhere else; for the development of personality from its germinal state to full consciousness is at once a charism and a curse. Its first result is the conscious and unavoidable separation of the single being from the undifferentiated and unconscious herd. This means isolation and there is no more comforting word for it. Neither family, nor society, nor position can save him from it... The development of personality is a favor that must be paid from dearly. - Jung

* In so far as every individual has his own inborn law of life, it is theoretically possible for every man to follow this law before all others and so to become a personality - that is, to achieve comleteness. - Jung

* Ultimately what is called personality is a great and myserious question. Hwile Jung has made a preliminary attempt at describing its nature there is still much to be discovered.

* in order to undergo a far-reaching psychological  development, neither outstanding intelligence nore any other talent is necessary... - Jung 

* One does not become enlihtened by imagiing figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. - Jung

* The rejection of the unconscious usually has unfortunate results... The more negative the attitude of the conscious towards the unconscious, the more dangerous does the latter become.

* everyone has in him something of the criminal, the genius, and the saint.




### Questions to address
* What is the new insight here
* How knowing this could help with everyday life
* Is there an internal light
