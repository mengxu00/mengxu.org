We're surrounded by things we at certain level of analysis seize to understand. 

Relavance determines productivity. Not time or time management. You are most productive in activities that naturally engages you. Many people can focus on video games, wood work, etc. for hours. They call this type of situation a "flow" state. These activities are often by no means easy. There's little to no correlation between the leve lof difficulty and 

The best way to update existing theory is, in my estimation, to learn from exceptions. To note your error, articulate them, and strive to fix.

This also mean that you can't fall in love with your most reliable theories no matter how much rationality it contains. Instead, you have to always allow room for updates.

This means that the more we learn the more ignorance we discover about ourselves. This also mean everyone makes mistakes no matter how.

To nature, this tiny fraction of the world's information is exactly what we need to survive and reproduce, or that's the best evolution can do.

Take your favorite room at home as an example. It is filled with light waves, visible and invisible, from infra-red to untra-vielet. In addition, there are also radio waves, natural radiations, and X-rays from the galaxy. But we only have a pair of detectors, each about 2-8 milimiters in diameter, to sense visible light spectrum. It is true that we only perceive a tiny fracton of electromagnetic fields filled in the room.

Only a little part of the world is relevant to our life.

### Appendix
### Why
I had strong wishes that I have good plans for life. Becasue in this way I can rule out obviously non-practical opportunities. A sounds plan also provides expectations of the future. This really helps with anxiety management.

However I also knew that future is rather unpredictable because we have very limitead knowledge of the current state - where we are right now. I want to explore how to plan and act in a rather non-predictable world by writing down pieces of thought and examine overtime.

I also feel that my ideas are quite fragmented. I feel that each idea is like searching a dim, long-lost name in my head. It becomes an impossible job to access when there is a list of 20 names like that. It would be interesting to lay them out at the same place and to put pieces together into a coherent line of thoughts.

### Starting points
* We are very blind to the information around us
* The tiny portion of things we pay attention to is what relevant to us. This is proved in action.
* If we're suffering, it might be well becasue of our limitation of attention
* Worse, that What relevant to us, or precisely what we value the most, might be the biggest obstacle preventing us from looking somewhere else.
* There are numerous 
* Facts relevant to one aim

### Questions to address
* What is the new insight here
* How knowing this could help with everyday life
* Is there an internal light
