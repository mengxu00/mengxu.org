### Appendix
### Why

* 

### Starting points
* Meditation puzzled me. I didn't understand what is the point of doing nothing but focusing on your breath as a common starting point. The idea of achieving hyper awareness or mindfulness sounds strange. How could you be more aware of things than you usually do? Obviously one can not be aware of everything in the universe at the same time. But if the stronger awareness means paying attention to things we normally ignore then, again, whist is the point? We ignore things for good reasons. 

* When you dream, part of your brain creates the scene while another part experiences it. It is like that the two parts of the brain communicate in a way resembles a stage show - one act as the producer, another as the audience.

* You might surprise yourself. Once in times you find your dreams strange to you. 


### Questions to address
* What is the new insight here
* How knowing this could help with everyday life
* Is there an internal light
